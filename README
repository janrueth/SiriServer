This is a very early version of a siri server.

We have a new plugin system,
check out the plugins folder and the example plugin for more infos

The file SiriProtocol documents everything I found out about the protocol by now

you need libspeex libflac installed

you also need the python package biplist (easy_install biplist)
you also need the python package M2Crypto (easy_install M2Crypto)

you need to generate a certificate, you can do this by going into "gen_certs" (example below)
cd gen_certs
./gen_certs.sh

this will generate a certifcaite for "guzzoni.apple.com" or (example below)
cd gen_certs
./gen_certs.sh 192.168.1.1
this will generate a certifcaite for "192.168.1.1"

make sure to install the CA certificate on your iDevice
